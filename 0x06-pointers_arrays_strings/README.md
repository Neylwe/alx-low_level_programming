# 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings

# Description
- A pointer is a variable whih contains a memory address.

# Arrays
- Are contiguous memory ares that hold a number of values of the same type. 
They are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring seperate
variables for each value.

# Strings
- Are one-dimensional array of characters terminated with a null character '\0'.

# Tasks objectives
- What are pointers and how to use them.
- What are arrays and how to use them.
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays.
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them.
- Scope of variables.

# Mandatory Tasks

0. strcat
- A function that concatenates two strings.
- This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte

1. strncat
- A function that concatenates two strings.
- The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes.

2. strncpy
- A function that copies a string.

3. strcmp
- A function that compares two strings

4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy
- A function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

5. Always look up
- A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes
- A function that capitalizes all words of a string.

7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody
- A function that encodes a string into 1337.

# Advanced Tasks

8. rot13
- A function that encodes a string using rot13.

9. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper
- function that prints an integer.

10. A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work
- Add one line to this code, so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.

11. It is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art
- A function that adds two numbers.

12. Noise is a buffer, more effective than cubicles or booth walls
- A function that prints a buffer.
