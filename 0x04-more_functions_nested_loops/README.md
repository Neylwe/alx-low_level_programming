# 0X04-more_functions_nested_loops

# Description
- A nested loop means a loop statement inside another loop statement. That is why nested loops are also called “loop inside loops“. We can define any number of loops inside another loop.

# Tasks objectives
- What are nested loops and how to use them
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
- What is a prototype
- Scope of variables
- What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra
- What are header files and how to to use them with #include
