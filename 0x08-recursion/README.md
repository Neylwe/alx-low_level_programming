# 0X08. C - Recursion

# Description
- Is a method where the solution to a problem depends to a problem depends on a solution to smaller instances of the same problem.
- It can be defined as the repetition of a process in a similar way until the specific condition reaches. In C Programming, if a function calls itself from inside, the same function iscalled recursion.
- The technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems whic are easier to solve.
